# [description]
# This test verifies that gl_ClipDistance may be implicitly
# sized, as specified in section 7.1 (Vertex Shader Special Variables)
# of the GLSL 1.30 spec:
#
#   The gl_ClipDistance array is predeclared as unsized and must be
#   sized by the shader either redeclaring it with a size or indexing
#   it only with integral constant expressions. This needs to size the
#   array to include all the clip planes that are enabled via the
#   OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes,
#   results are undefined. The size can be at most
#   gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components (see
#   gl_MaxVaryingComponents) consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match
#   the size of the array, no matter how many planes are enabled. The
#   shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have been
#   enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined. Values
#   written into gl_ClipDistance for planes that are not enabled have
#   no effect.
#
# It does so by using 8 clip distances to progressively reject points
# with x coordinate less than 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and
# 0.8.  (The end result of this should be to clip all values with x
# coordinate less than 0.8).  It then verifies proper clipping
# behavior by probing points with x coordinates 0.75 and 0.85.
