/**
 * \file clip-distance-not-sizeable-above-max.c
 *
 * From the GLSL 1.30 spec section 7.1 (Vertex Shader Special
 * Variables):
 *
 *   The gl_ClipDistance array is predeclared as unsized and must be
 *   sized by the shader either redeclaring it with a size or indexing
 *   it only with integral constant expressions. This needs to size
 *   the array to include all the clip planes that are enabled via the
 *   OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes,
 *   results are undefined. The size can be at most
 *   gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components (see
 *   gl_MaxVaryingComponents) consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match
 *   the size of the array, no matter how many planes are enabled. The
 *   shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have been
 *   enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined. Values
 *   written into gl_ClipDistance for planes that are not enabled have
 *   no effect.
 *
 * This test checks that the an error occurs when trying to set the
 * size of gl_ClipDistance larger than gl_MaxClipDistances.
 *
 * Note: we don't care about the specific error that is generated or
 * the precise circumstances under which it occurs--we just want to
 * make sure that gl_MaxClipDistances isn't too small.  So to provoke
 * the error into occurring, we also try to access the first
 * disallowed element of the array.
