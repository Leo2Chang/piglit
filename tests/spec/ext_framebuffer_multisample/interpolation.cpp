/**
 * \file interpolation.cpp
 *
 * Verify that the implementation interpolates varyings correctly when
 * multisampling is in use, particularly that it properly implements
 * the "centroid" keyword.
 *
 * From the GLSL 1.30 spec, section 4.3.7 (Interpolation):
 *
 *     "This paragraph only applies if interpolation is being done: If
 *     single-sampling, the value is interpolated to the pixel's
 *     center, and the centroid qualifier, if present, is ignored. If
 *     multi-sampling and the variable is not qualified with centroid,
 *     then the value must be interpolated to the pixel's center, or
 *     anywhere within the pixel, or to one of the pixel's samples. If
 *     multi-sampling and the variable is qualified with centroid,
 *     then the value must be interpolated to a point that lies in
 *     both the pixel and in the primitive being rendered, or to one
 *     of the pixel's samples that falls within the primitive. Due to
 *     the less regular location of centroids, their derivatives may
 *     be less accurate than non-centroid interpolated variables."
 *
 *
 * This test accepts two command-line parameters, a value for
 * num_samples, and a test type.  The test types are as follows:
 *
 * - non-centroid-disabled: verify that non-centroid interpolation
 *   produces the same results when applied to a non-multisampled
 *   buffer and a multisampled buffer with GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled.
 *   This effectively verifies that non-centroid varyings are
 *   interpolated at the pixel center when single-sampling.  The test
 *   uses a fragment shader that sets the red, green, and blue
 *   channels to the barycentric coordinates within each triangle.
 *
 * - centroid-disabled: verify that centroid interpolation produces
 *   the same results as non-centroid interpolation when applied to a
 *   multisampled buffer with GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled.  This
 *   effectively verifies that centroid varyings are interpolated at
 *   the pixel center when single-sampling.  This test may also be run
 *   with num_samples=0 to verify that centroid varyings work properly
 *   in non-multisampled buffers.  The test uses a fragment shader
 *   that sets the red, green, and blue channels to the barycentric
 *   coordinates within each triangle.
 *
 * - centroid-edges: verify that centroid interpolation occurs at
 *   points that lie within the extents of the triangle, even for
 *   pixels on triangle edges, where the center of the pixel might lie
 *   outside the extents of the triangle.  The test uses a fragment
 *   shader that sets the blue channel to 1.0 (so that the triangles
 *   can be seen) and the red and green channels to 1.0 if any of the
 *   centroid-interpolated barycentric coordinates is outside the
 *   range [0, 1].
 *
 * - non-centroid-deriv: verify that the numeric derivative of a
 *   varying using non-centroid interpolation is correct, even at
 *   triangle edges.  This ensures that the implementation properly
 *   handles a subtle corner case: since numeric derivatives are
 *   usually computed using finite differences between adjacent
 *   pixels, it's possible that the value of a varying at a completely
 *   uncovered pixel might be used.  In effect, this tests that the
 *   values of varyings are correct on completely uncovered pixels, if
 *   those values are needed for derivatives.  This test may also be
 *   run with num_samples=0 to verify that non-centroid varyings
 *   exhibit proper derivative behaviour in non-multisampled buffers.
 *   The test uses a fragment shader that sets red=dFdx(interpolated x
 *   coordinate), green=dFdy(interpolated y coordinate), and blue=1.0,
 *   with appropriate scaling applied to the red and green outputs so
 *   that the expected output is red=0.5 and green=0.5.
 *
 * - non-centroid-deriv-disabled: Like non-centroid-deriv, but the
 *   test is done with GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled.
 *
 * - centroid-deriv: verify that the numeric derivative of a vaying
 *   using centroid interpolation is within reasonable bounds.  Any
 *   derivative value between 0 and twice the expected derivative is
 *   considered passing, since this is the expected error bound for a
 *   typical implementation (where derivative is computed via a finite
 *   difference of adjacent pixels, and sample points are within the
 *   pixel boundary). As with non-centroid-deriv, this test may also
 *   be run with num_samples=0 to verify that centroid varyings
 *   exhibit proper derivative behaviour in non-multisampled buffers;
 *   in this case, the error bounds are as in non-centroid-deriv,
 *   since centroid-related derivative errors are not expected.  When
 *   num_samples=0, the fragment shader generates outputs as in
 *   non-centroid-deriv.  Otherwise it sets the blue channel to 1.0
 *   (so that the triangles can be seen) and the red nd green channels
 *   to 1.0 if either derivative is out of tolerance.
 *
 * - centroid-deriv-disabled: like centroid-deriv, but the test is
 *   done with GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled, and the error bounds are as in
 *   non-centroid-deriv.  The fragment shader generates outputs as in
 *   non-centroid-deriv.
 *
 * All test types draw an array of small triangles at various
 * rotations, so that pixels are covered in a wide variety of
 * patterns.  In each case the rendered result is displayed on the
 * left, and the expected result is displayed on the right for
 * comparison.
