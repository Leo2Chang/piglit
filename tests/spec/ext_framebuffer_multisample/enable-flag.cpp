/**
 * \file enable-flag.cpp
 *
 * This test verifies the proper functioning of the GL_MULTISAMPLE
 * flag.  It operates by performing the following operations:
 *
 * 1. Verify that the default state of GL_MULTISAMPLE is enabled.
 *
 * 2. Draw a test image into a multisampled buffer, with
 *    GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled.
 *
 * 3. Blit this image to the left half of the piglit window (which is
 *    not multisampled) to resolve it.
 *
 * 4. Draw the same test image into a single-sampled buffer.
 *
 * 5. Blit this image to the right half of the piglit window.
 *
 * 6. Verify that the two halves of the piglit window match.  If they
 *    don't, then presumably the disabling of GL_MULTISAMPLE failed to
 *    take effect.
