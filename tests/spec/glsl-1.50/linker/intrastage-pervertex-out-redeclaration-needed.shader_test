# From section 7.1 (Built-In Language Variables) of the GLSL 4.10
# spec:
#
#     If multiple shaders using members of a built-in block belonging
#     to the same interface are linked together in the same program,
#     they must all redeclare the built-in block in the same way, as
#     described in section 4.3.7 "Interface Blocks" for interface
#     block matching, or a link error will result.  It will also be a
#     link error if some shaders in a program redeclare a specific
#     built-in interface block while another shader in that program
#     does not redeclare that interface block yet still uses a member
#     of that interface block.
#
# This appears to be a clarification to the behaviour established for
# gl_PerVertex by GLSL 1.50, therefore we test it using GLSL version
# 1.50.
#
# The definition of "interface" in section 4.3.7 that applies here is
# as follows:
#
#     The boundary between adjacent programmable pipeline stages: This
#     spans all the outputs in all compilation units of the first
#     stage and all the inputs in all compilation units of the second
#     stage.
#
# Therefore this rule applies to both inter- and intra-stage linking.
#
# In this test we exercise intrastage linking of the gl_PerVertex
# "out" interface block, and we verify the link error that is supposed
# to occur if some shaders redeclare gl_PerVertex and others do not.
